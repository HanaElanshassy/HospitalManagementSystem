# **Patient Management System** 🏥  



## **Project Overview**  
This **Patient Management System** is designed to **organize patient records, manage appointments, billing, and generate reports** for a hospital. It ensures efficient access, scheduling, and modification of patient data.  

The project follows **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Java Swing** for a user-friendly experience. **A Binary Search Tree (BST) is used for fast patient searching.**  
I was the team leader for this project.

## **Key Features**  

### 👩‍⚕️ **Patient Management**  
- Add, search, and update patient records  
- Store patient **contact details, medical history, and visit records**  
- **Efficient searching using Binary Search Tree (BST)**  

### 📅 **Appointment Scheduling**  
- Schedule, cancel, and reschedule patient appointments  
- Prevents overbooking using a **waiting list with a priority queue**  
- Allows doctors to view appointments for specific days  

### ⏳ **Waiting List Management**  
- Adds patients to a **priority queue** if appointments are full  
- Assigns the next available appointment when a slot opens  

### 💰 **Billing System**  
- Generates **bills and payment records** for patients  
- Allows patients to view their **payment status**  

### 📊 **Report Generation**  
- Generates **patient visit reports, appointment summaries, and revenue reports**  
- Uses **sorting algorithms (Merge Sort / Quick Sort)** for efficient data retrieval  

### 🖥️ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
- Built with **Java Swing** for an interactive experience  
- Provides intuitive forms for managing **patients, appointments, and billing**

## **Data Structures Used**  

### **Binary Search Tree (BST) for Patient Search** 🌳  
- **Patients are stored in a BST**, allowing fast **O(log n) search time.**  
- The tree is **ordered by Patient ID**, enabling quick lookup and updates.  

### **Priority Queue for Waiting List** ⏳  
- A **priority queue** ensures urgent patients get scheduled first.  

### **Sorting Algorithms** 📊  
- **Merge Sort / Quick Sort** are used for generating reports efficiently.
